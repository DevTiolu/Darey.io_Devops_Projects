# What is Linux?

**Linux** is the best-known and most-used open source operating system. Popular distributions include **Ubuntu**, **Fedora**, **CentOS**, **openSUSE**, and **Red Hat**.

Most Linux distributions use **graphical user interface (GUI)**, making them beginner-friendly. However, it is recommended to use the **command line interface (CLI)** because it's quicker and offers more control.

## Basic Commands in Linux

**Linux commands** are a type of Unix command or shell procedure. They run on the **command line interface (CLI)** and interact with your system via texts and processes.

Linux commands are used to perform a variety of tasks, including displaying information about files and directories.

### `sudo` command

**sudo** which is short for **superuser do** is a command that lets you perform tasks that require administrative permissions.
