This solution embodies the principles of DevOps, which aims to enhance collaboration between development and operations teams, improve the efficiency of workflows, and ensure the reliability and scalability of applications.
DevOps Tooling Website Solution leverages a combination of tools and practices to automate and optimize the entire lifecycle of web applications. From code development to deployment and monitoring, it ensures a seamless, efficient, and reliable process.
Key Components and Tools
Version Control System (VCS)

Git/GitHub/GitLab: These are used to manage and track changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to collaborate efficiently.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Jenkins/GitLab CI/Travis CI: CI/CD tools automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code. They ensure that new code changes are continuously integrated and deployed to production with minimal manual intervention.

Configuration Management

Ansible/Chef/Puppet: These tools automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure. They ensure that systems are configured consistently and can be replicated easily across different environments.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Terraform/CloudFormation: IaC tools allow infrastructure to be defined and managed using code, making it easy to provision and scale resources in a repeatable manner.

Containerization

Docker: Docker packages applications and their dependencies into containers, ensuring that they run consistently across different environments.

Container Orchestration

Kubernetes/Docker Swarm: These platforms manage the deployment, scaling, and operation of containerized applications across clusters of machines.

Monitoring and Logging

Prometheus/Grafana/ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana): Monitoring tools collect metrics and logs from applications and infrastructure, providing visibility into system performance and helping to identify issues.

In this project you will implement a solution that consists of following components:

Implementing A Tooling Website
STEP 1 – PREPARE NFS SERVER

Spin up a new EC2 instance with RHEL Linux 8 Operating System.
alt text

Based on your LVM experience from Project 6, Configure LVM on the Server.
create volumes for the NFS server
alt text

alt text

using the gdisk utility to create partitions

alt text

Once partition is created install lvm2 using sudo yum install lvm2 then carry out the other process as in the previous project.

Create physical volume and volume group. Refer to the previous project for this.

Use lvcreate to create logical volumes of size 10G, 10G and 8G each.

Instead of formating the disks as ext4 you will have to format them as xfs sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/webdata-vg/lv-apps sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/webdata-vg/lv-logs sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/webdata-vg/lv-opt

alt text

Ensure there are 3 Logical Volumes. lv-opt lv-apps, and lv-logs
Create mount points on /mnt directory for the logical volumes as follow:
Mount lv-apps on /mnt/apps – To be used by webservers

Mount lv-logs on /mnt/logs – To be used by webserver logs

Mount lv-opt on /mnt/opt – To be used by Jenkins server in Project 8

sudo mkdir /mnt/apps

sudo mkdir /mnt/logs

sudo mkdir /mnt/opt

sudo mount /dev/webdata-vg/lv-apps /mnt/apps

sudo mount /dev/webdata-vg/lv-logs /mnt/logs

sudo mount /dev/webdata-vg/lv-opt /mnt/opt
Once mount is completed run sudo blkid to get the UUID of the mount part, open and paste the UUID in the fstab file.
alt text

Edit fstab file and paste the UUID of the mount part

  sudo vi /etc/fstab
```
sudo mount -a 
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```
Install NFS server, configure it to start on reboot and make sure it is u and running
sudo yum -y update

sudo yum install nfs-utils -y

sudo systemctl start nfs-server.service

sudo systemctl enable nfs-server.service

sudo systemctl status nfs-server.service
alt text

Export the mounts for webservers’ subnet cidr to connect as clients. For simplicity, you will install your all three Web Servers inside the same subnet, but in production set up you would probably want to separate each tier inside its own subnet for higher level of security. To check your subnet cidr – open your EC2 details in AWS web console and locate ‘Networking’ tab and open a Subnet link:
alt text

Make sure we set up permission that will allow our Web servers to read, write and execute files on NFS:
sudo chown -R nobody: /mnt/apps

sudo chown -R nobody: /mnt/logs

sudo chown -R nobody: /mnt/opt

sudo chmod -R 777 /mnt/apps

sudo chmod -R 777 /mnt/logs

sudo chmod -R 777 /mnt/opt

sudo systemctl restart nfs-server.service
Configure access to NFS for clients within the same subnet (example of Subnet CIDR – 172.31.32.0/20):
sudo nano /etc/exports

/mnt/apps 172.31.32.0/20(rw,sync,no_all_squash,no_root_squash)
/mnt/logs 172.31.32.0/20(rw,sync,no_all_squash,no_root_squash)
/mnt/opt 172.31.32.0/20(rw,sync,no_all_squash,no_root_squash)
Save and close the file.

sudo exportfs -arv

alt text

Check which port is used by NFS and open it using Security Groups (add new Inbound Rule)
rpcinfo -p | grep nfs

alt text

Important note: In order for NFS server to be accessible from your client, you must also open following ports: TCP 111, UDP 111, UDP 2049

alt text

STEP 2 – CONFIGURE THE DATABASE SERVER

Install MySQL server
sudo apt install mysql

Create a database and name it tooling
 sudo mysql
 create database tooling;
Create a database user and name it webaccess
create user 'webaccess'@'172.31.32.0/20' identified by 'mypasskey';

Grant permission to webaccess user on tooling database to do anything only from the webservers subnet cidr
grant all privileges on tooling.* to 'webaccess'@'172.31.80.0/20';

alt text

STEP 3 - PREPARE THE WEB SERVERS During the next steps we will do following:

Configure NFS client (this step must be done on all three servers)

Deploy a Tooling application to our Web Servers into a shared NFS folder

Configure the Web Servers to work with a single MySQL database

Launch three new EC2 instance with RHEL 8 Operating System

Install NFS client

sudo yum install nfs-utils nfs4-acl-tools -y

alt text

Mount /var/www/ and target the NFS server’s export for apps
sudo mkdir /var/www
sudo mount -t nfs -o rw,nosuid <NFS-Server-Private-IP-Address>:/mnt/apps /var/www
Verify that NFS was mounted successfully by running df -h. Make sure that the changes will persist on Web Server after reboot:
sudo nano /etc/fstab

add following line;

:/mnt/apps /var/www nfs defaults 0 0

alt text

Install Remi’s repository, Apache and PHP
sudo yum install httpd -y

sudo yum install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm

sudo yum install dnf-utils http://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-8.rpm

sudo yum module  list php -y

sudo yum module reset php -y

sudo yum module enable php:remi-7.4 -y

sudo yum install php php-opcache php-gd php-curl php-mysqlnd -y

sudo systemctl start php-fpm

sudo systemctl enable php-fpm

sudo setsebool -P httpd_execmem 1

sudo systemctl restart httpd
steps 1-5 for should be done for webserver 1, 2 and 3

Verify that Apache files and directories are available on the Web Server in /var/www and also on the NFS server in /mnt/apps. If you see the same files – it means NFS is mounted correctly. You can try to create a new file touch test.txt from one server and check if the same file is accessible from other Web Servers.

Locate the log folder for Apache on the Web Server and mount it to NFS server’s export for logs. Repeat step 4 under the 'prepare web servers' to make sure the mount point will persist after reboot.

Fork the tooling source code from Darey.io Github Account to your Github account.

alt text

Deploy the tooling website’s code to the Webserver. Ensure that the html folder from the repository is deployed to /var/www/html
alt text

Copy all content inside the html folder into /var/www/html.
sudo cp -R html/. /var/www/html

Note 1: Do not forget to open TCP port 80 on the Web Server.

Note 2: If you encounter 403 Error – check permissions to your /var/www/html folder and also disable SELinux sudo setenforce 0

To make this change permanent – open following config file sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/selinux and set SELINUX=disabled then restart httpd.

alt text

sudo systemctl restart httpd
sudo systemctl status httpd
Update the website’s configuration to connect to the database (in /var/www/html/functions.php file). Apply tooling-db.sql script to your database using this command mysql -h -u -p < tooling-db.sql
$db = mysqli_connect('172.31.20.138', 'webaccess', 'mypasskey', 'tooling');

Install MySQL on the web servers using sudo yum install mysql -y then cd into the tooling directory to connect to thhe database.
sudo mysql -h 172.31.20.138 -u webaccess -p tooling < tooling-db.sql

If you can't connect to it and there is an error simply move to the DB server to edit the inbound security group.

alt text

Then edit the mysqld.cnf file

sudo vi /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d//mysqld.cnf
alt text

sudo systemctl restart mysql

sudo systemctl status mysql
Create in MySQL a new admin user with username: myuser and password: password: INSERT INTO ‘users’ (‘id’, ‘username’, ‘password’, ’email’, ‘user_type’, ‘status’) VALUES -> (1, ‘myuser’, ‘5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99’, ‘user@mail.com’, ‘admin’, ‘1’);
alt text

Open the website in your browser http:///index.php and make sure you can login into the websute with myuser user.
